I'm Calvin Cordula Mawuena, a researcher dedicated to building secure and equitable AI systems, with a particular focus on the "security gap" in Large Language Models (LLMs) within low-resource linguistic environments. My background spans from atmospheric data science to leading multidisciplinary teams in LLM research.

🔬 **Core Research Interests**

- **Multilingual NLP**: Developing robust NMT frameworks for typologically diverse low-resource languages.
- **LLM Security**: Investigating the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs and data poisoning.
- **Model Alignment**: Leveraging RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to enhance model safety and interpretability.
- Open-source AI & ML projects
- Research & development in NLP and Computer Vision
- AI-driven applications for real-world impact


🛠️ **Technical Toolkit**

- Languages: Python (2+ years professional experience), C++, SQL, LaTeX.
- Frameworks: Transformer models, RLHF, RAG, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy.
- Scientific Computing: XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Time Series Analysis.
Scikit-learn, Time Series Analysis, NumPy, Pandas, RLHF (Applied), Generative AI


⚙️ **Philosophy**

"Giving your shoulders as a platform to elevate another is the best gift you can offer society." I am committed to "Socially Sustainable AI" and mentoring the next generation of STEM researchers
